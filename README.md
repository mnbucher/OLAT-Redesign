# OLAT 10.0 (UZH) Polishing

## Introduction

This project was initially founded due to *incomprehension* about the new User Interface of the new Learning Management System (LMS) developed by the University of Zurich (UZH). 
See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLAT) for more details about OLAT. The new version of the platform was published over the summer 2016 and not only the new UI is extremely ugly, but there are also some very bad UX pracices.

So with this in mind, we have the approach, to clean up this messy platform to make it a much more asthetic place with less overloaded content and to polish the whole User Interface. As students, we daily spend a lot of time on this platform. So we want to make this thing a more beeautiful place.
